# AMAZON-ELECTRONIC-SALES 
Description:
This project dives into the world of online electronics sales by analyzing a publicly available dataset from Amazon on Kaggle.  Using Python libraries and data science principles, we'll explore customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. These insights can be used to understand market dynamics and potentially inform strategic business decisions.

Technologies:
Programming Language: Python (Data analysis and visualization)
Libraries:
Pandas (Data manipulation)
NumPy (Numerical computing)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data visualization)

Task List:
1-Import Libraries and Load Data
2-Clean and Preprocess Data
3-Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4-Draw Conclusions and Insights

Running the Project:
Clone this repository.
Install required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter Notebook(s) or Python script(s) for analysis.

Output:
The analysis will generate visualizations and reports summarizing the findings. These outputs will be located in the project
